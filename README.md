## Why we need AI at Tolls?

* In most countries, traffic is a common problem with the increased mobility.
* On average,  a vehicle spends 3-5 minutes at tolls.
* In populated countries like India, the waiting time at tolls would last for hours on special days.
* Most of the work at the tolls is manual and this leads to longer waiting time.

## How does AI makes the work easier and faster?
* Let's get started with the work flow
